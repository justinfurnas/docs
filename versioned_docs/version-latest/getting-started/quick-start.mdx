Start your Server and first Package in under 10 minutes!

import { Classes } from '@site/docs/components/_nanos.mdx';
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import { ReferenceLink } from '@site/docs/components/_nanos.mdx';


## Step 1: Download the Server

You have **three** options for downloading nanos world server:

1. Use the executable (*.exe*) already located at `nanos-world/Server/NanosWorldServer.exe` (if you downloaded the base game).
2. Use SteamCMD to [download nanos world‚Ñ¢ Dedicated Server](/core-concepts/server-manual/server-installation.md).
3. Or download **nanos world‚Ñ¢ Dedicated Server** tool from Steam Client.


## Step 2: Creating a Basic Package

After downloading the server, let's create a basic Package. We will use the handy CLI tool to speed up the proccess:

For that, open a terminal in your server folder and run the following command:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="cmd"
  values={[
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'cmd'},
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="cmd">

```shell
./NanosWorldServer.exe --cli add package my-awesome-package
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux">

```shell
./NanosWorldServer.sh --cli add package my-awesome-package
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This command will run the CLI to interactively create your new package:
```shell
[display] Please enter the Package Name: (my-awesome-package)

[display] Please enter the Package Author: ()

[display] Please enter the Package Version: (0.0.1)

[display] Please enter the Package Image URL: ()

[display] Please enter the Package Author: ()

[display] Please enter the Package Type: (game-mode)
```

After that, you will end up with a new folder inside `Packages/` called `my-awesome-package/`. Inside that there will be 3 other folders: `Server/`, `Client/` and `Shared/`, and a package file `Package.toml`.

Additionally, if this was the first time running the CLI, it will also create a `Config.toml` file at the root of the server folder executable. This is the server configuration file!


## Step 3: Adding Script functionalities

Open the file `my-awesome-package/Server/Index.lua` in your preferred editor (we recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)), and let's edit our first script. Let's spawn some <Classes.Prop />s!

```lua title="Packages/my-awesome-package/Server/Index.lua"
-- Let's print to Console a friendly message
Package.Log("Loading some Props =D")

-- Let's spawn some props
prop_table = Prop(Vector(200, 0, 0), Rotator(0, 0, 0), "nanos-world::SM_WoodenTable")
prop_chair = Prop(Vector(400, 200, 0), Rotator(0, 0, 0), "nanos-world::SM_WoodenChair")
prop_tire = Prop(Vector(600, 0, 0), Rotator(0, 0, 0), "nanos-world::SM_TireLarge")
```


## Step 4: Starting the server

Now let's start the server with the package you just created! For that, simply double click or launch the server from the terminal:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="cmd"
  values={[
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'cmd'},
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="cmd">

```shell
./NanosWorldServer.exe
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux">

```shell
./NanosWorldServer.sh
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After starting it, your console will display something like this:

```
[display]  nanos world (C) Copyright nanos. All Rights Reserved.
[display]  Starting Server at Port: 7777. Version: 0.0.0. Map: 'nanos-world::TestingMap'.
[display]  Loading Package 'my-awesome-package'...
[script]   Loading some Props =D
[display]  Package 'my-awesome-package' loaded.
[display]  Loading Package 'map-package'...
[display]  Package 'map-package' loaded.
```

You can see it loaded your package and outputted the text "Loading some Props =D" on it.


## Step 4: Join your server

Now let's see the results in-game! Open nanos world and connect to localhost at `127.0.0.1:7777`.

After connecting, you will be a flying pawn and will be able to see the props spawned! üòÅ

## Extra Step: Spawning Characters

### Spawning a Character for the Player

You may have noticed you are just a wandering soul flying around, let's give you some flesh! For that, we will need to interact with some **Events**.

Let's append some code in your `Index.lua`, to spawn a <Classes.Character /> when the <Classes.Player /> join the server:

```lua title="my-package/Server/Index.lua"
-- Function to spawn a Character to a player
function SpawnCharacter(player)
    -- Spawns a Character at position 0, 0, 0 with default's constructor parameters
    local new_character = Character(Vector(0, 0, 0))

    -- Possess the new Character
    player:Possess(new_character)
end

-- Subscribes to an Event which is triggered when Players join the server (i.e. Spawn)
Player.Subscribe("Spawn", SpawnCharacter)

-- Iterates for all already connected players and give them a Character as well
-- This will make sure you also get a Character when you reload the package
for k, player in pairs(Player.GetAll()) do
    SpawnCharacter(player)
end
```

To apply your changes, run the command in the server console: `package reload all`. This will also live reload the packages and apply the changes immediatelly.

### Destroying the Character when the Player leaves the Server

Note that the <Classes.Character /> isn't destroyed automatically when the <Classes.Player /> disconnects. For that, we will need to Subscribe for when the Player leaves the server (`Destroy` event) and manually destroying the Character.

Append this code:

```lua title="my-package/Server/Index.lua"
-- When Player leaves the server, destroy it's Character
Player.Subscribe("Destroy", function(player)
    local character = player:GetControlledCharacter()
    if (character) then
        character:Destroy()
    end
end)
```

To apply your changes, run the command in the server console: `package reload all`.
